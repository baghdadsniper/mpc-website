					<description><![CDATA[<strong class="vial">Vial &#x7C; 5 ml &#x7C; gm</strong>
<strong>Active ingredients :</strong>
    • Glutathione 1000
    • Vitamin C 
<hr>
<strong>Benefits :  </strong>
    • Glutathione + Vit C is a antioxidant that replicates the skin antioxidant network, keeps vitamin C stable in the skin and enhances its properties. Glutathione and vitamin C act as networking antioxidants that can recycle each other from their radicalized forms back to their active, antioxidant forms. Through this process of mutual regeneration, networking antioxidants enhance and extend each other’s capacities, working within and around the mitochondria where most of the cellular oxidation occurs.
    • Plays an important role in cell protection during ageing, acting both as an anti-oxidant and a detoxifying agent.
    • Ability to inhibit melanin synthesis makes it an essential component of melasma and depigmentation treatments.
<hr>
<strong> Gluta-C 1000 for : </strong>
    • Hyperpigmentation
    • Dehydrated skin
    • Hormonal changes
    • Rosacea
    • Stretchmarks
    • Smoker’s skin
<hr>
<strong> Areas of treatment : </strong>
    • Body
