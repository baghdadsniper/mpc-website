					<description><![CDATA[<strong class="vial"> Vial &#x7C; 5 ml &#x7C; gm </strong>
<strong>Active ingredients :</strong>
    • Pentanoic acid 50 mg (Plant extract)
    • Enzyme co-factors
    • Hexa-hydro-thieno
<hr>
<strong>Benefits : </strong>
    • Hair-Stem Cells : accelerated hair follicle stem cell activation, increasing the hair cycle  increase blood circulation .
    • Hair follicle stem cell metabolism is different from other cells of the skin. Cellular metabolism involves the breakdown of the nutrients needed for cells to divide, make energy and respond to their environment. The process of metabolism uses enzymes that alter these nutrients to produce metabolites. 
    • The hair follicle is an ideal system to examine stem cell populations during aging. Stem cells in a compartment of the hair follicle called the bulge give rise to hair. When hair falls out, it can be replaced  new hair generated  the remaining stem cells. Permanent hair loss was thought to occur when most of these stem cells were damaged or died.
