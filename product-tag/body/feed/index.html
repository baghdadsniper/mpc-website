					<description><![CDATA[<strong class="vial"> Vial &#x7C; 5 ml &#x7C; gm </strong>
<strong>Active ingredients :</strong>
    • Hyaluronic acid  35 mg/ml
<hr>
<strong>Benefits :  </strong>
    • Pure, non-crosslinked hyaluronic acid is a highly-effective skin moisturizing agent.
    • Hyaluronic acid offers an effective way to fight against the effects of reduced levels of hyaluronic acid. It is distributed widely throughout connective and plentiful in our bodies when we are born, but its levels gradually decline over time. This reduction in levels is a big part of the aging process, loss of elasticity in the skin that manifests itself in wrinkles.
    • Hyaluronic acid fills the space between collagen and elastin fibers. The role of hyaluronic acid in skin is to provide a mechanism of transport of essential nutrients from the bloodstream to living skin cells, hydrate the skin  holding in water and to contribute to dermis renewal and elimination of harmful compounds from the skin.
    •  Hyaluronic acid also acts on angiogenesis  supporting the proliferation of endothelial cells and thus allowing better cutaneous vascularization.

					<description><![CDATA[<strong class="vial"> Vial &#x7C; 5 ml &#x7C; gm </strong>
<strong>Active ingredients :</strong>
    • Dmae 25 mg/ml
    • Organic silicium 15 mg/ml
<hr>
<strong>Benefits : </strong> 
    • Dimethylaminoethanol  acts immediately to improve the appearance of sagging and flaccid skin. Its firming action works  protecting the elastin and collagen cross-links.
    • DMAE provides an instant face or body-lift effect, while defending the skin against free radicals and simultaneously infusing it with moisture.
    • DMAE started to be used in external use to produce a lifting effect. It is a natural compound in our body.
    • A precursor of acetylcholine, a neuro-mediator which plays an important role in the skin. Keratinocytes, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, sweat cells and endothelial cells, have membrane receptors and respond to acetylcholine.
    • Organic silica :Binds moisture into the epidermis and therefore strengthens the skin .
    • Improves skin elasticity .
<hr>
<strong>DMAE for :</strong>
    • Firms the skin on the neck and body .
    • Anti-aging , early signs of ageing .
    • Reduces &#038; prevents stretch marks .
    • Increase the skin elasticity .
    • Stimulates collagen production .
<hr>
<strong>Areas of treatment :</strong>
    • Face
    • Neck
    • Body 
<hr>
<strong>How to use ? </strong>
By injection  or derma-pen
