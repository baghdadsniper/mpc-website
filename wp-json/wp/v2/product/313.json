Cellular metabolism involves the breakdown of the nutrients needed for cells to divide, make energy and respond to their environment. The process of metabolism uses enzymes that alter these nutrients to produce metabolites.\u00a0<br \/>\n    \u2022 The hair follicle is an ideal system to examine stem cell populations during aging. Stem cells in a compartment of the hair follicle called the bulge give rise to hair. When\u00a0hair falls out, it can be replaced by new hair generated by the remaining stem cells. Permanent hair loss was thought to occur when most of these stem cells were damaged or died.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>H-Stem Cells for :<\/strong><br \/>\n    \u2022 Hair disorder (Telogen phase , Catagen phase)<br \/>\n    \u2022 Androgenetic alopecia (AGA)<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Areas of treatment :<\/strong><br \/>\n    \u2022 Scalp<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong> How to use ? <\/strong><br \/>\nBy injection  or derma-pen<br \/>\nDilution 1: 0.5 Proportion<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":760,"template":"","meta":{"_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":""},"product_cat":[25],"product_tag":[37,38],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mpcmesotherapy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product\/313"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mpcmesotherapy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mpcmesotherapy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/product"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mpcmesotherapy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/760"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mpcmesotherapy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=313"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"product_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mpcmesotherapy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat?post=313"},{"taxonomy":"product_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mpcmesotherapy.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_tag?post=313"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
